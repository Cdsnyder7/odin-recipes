# odin-recipes
This is my first project with odin! Should include something about recipes. Only time will tell haha. 

This website will be a basic recipe website. It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. It won't look very pretty, but it is mainly a project to build my HTML chops; I should revisit it in the future to style it up when I start learning CSS.
