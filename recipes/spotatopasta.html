                <li>Place the cubed sweet potatos into a large, rimmed baking sheet and

                    oven for 15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>After baking for 15 minutes, take the sweet potato out, toss in the 
                    garlic and mix well. Place the sweet potato back in for another 15 
                    minutes. While it is roasting, start to boil the pasta.

                <li>When the sweet potatos are done, pull them out and toss with the 
                    red chili flakes and your choice of herb. Drop the sweet potato
                    into the pasta and then dribble another tablespoon of olive oil 
                    and mix. Stir in a little cooked pasta sauce, just enough to
